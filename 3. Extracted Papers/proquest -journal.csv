Abnormality Detection and Failure Prediction Using Explainable Bayesian Deep Learning: Methodology and Case Study with Industrial Data,,"Ahmad Kamal Mohd Nor; Ahmad Kamal Mohd Nor; Srinivasa Rao Pedapati; Masdi Muhammad; Leiva, Víctor",Mathematics,Scholarly Journals,,10,4,2022-01-01,2022,554,,,22277390,,,ENG,"Mistrust, amplified by numerous artificial intelligence (AI) related incidents, is an issue that has caused the energy and industrial sectors to be amongst the slowest adopter of AI methods. Central to this issue is the black-box problem of AI, which impedes investments and is fast becoming a legal hazard for users. Explainable AI (XAI) is a recent paradigm to tackle such an issue. Being the backbone of the industry, the prognostic and health management (PHM) domain has recently been introduced into XAI. However, many deficiencies, particularly the lack of explanation assessment methods and uncertainty quantification, plague this young domain. In the present paper, we elaborate a framework on explainable anomaly detection and failure prognostic employing a Bayesian deep learning model and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to generate local and global explanations from the PHM tasks. An uncertainty measure of the Bayesian model is utilized as a marker for anomalies and expands the prognostic explanation scope to include the model’s confidence. In addition, the global explanation is used to improve prognostic performance, an aspect neglected from the handful of studies on PHM-XAI. The quality of the explanation is examined employing local accuracy and consistency properties. The elaborated framework is tested on real-world gas turbine anomalies and synthetic turbofan failure prediction data. Seven out of eight of the tested anomalies were successfully identified. Additionally, the prognostic outcome showed a 19% improvement in statistical terms and achieved the highest prognostic score amongst best published results on the topic.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2632954468?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=jQXuNsry3b194eYHxH6p%2BG0Wz9E%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/math10040554
The Enlightening Role of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Chronic Wound Classification,,"Salih Sarp; Kuzlu, Murat; Wilson, Emmanuel; Cali, Umit; Guler, Ozgur",Electronics,Scholarly Journals,,10,12,2021-01-01,2021,1406,,,20799292,,,ENG,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been among the most emerging research and industrial application fields, especially in the healthcare domain, but operated as a black-box model with a limited understanding of its inner working over the past decades. AI algorithms are, in large part, built on weights calculated as a result of large matrix multiplications. It is typically hard to interpret and debug the computationally intensive processes. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to solve black-box and hard-to-debug approaches through the use of various techniques and tools. In this study, XAI techniques are applied to chronic wound classification. The proposed model classifies chronic wounds through the use of transfer learning and fully connected layers. Classified chronic wound images serve as input to the XAI model for an explanation. Interpretable results can help shed new perspectives to clinicians during the diagnostic phase. The proposed method successfully provides chronic wound classification and its associated explanation to extract additional knowledge that can also be interpreted by non-data-science experts, such as medical scientists and physicians. This hybrid approach is shown to aid with the interpretation and understanding of AI decision-making processes.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2544961040?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=vEKkWxLbNoh%2FLiG3eUZMQmHK584%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10121406
Info-CELS: Informative Saliency Map-Guided Counterfactual Explanation for Time Series Classification,,"Li, Peiyu; Bahri, Omar; Hosseinzadeh, Pouya; Soukaïna Filali Boubrahimi; Shah, Muhammad Hamdi",Electronics,Scholarly Journals,,14,7,2025-01-01,2025,1311,,,20799292,,,ENG,"As the demand for interpretable machine learning approaches continues to grow, there is an increasing necessity for human involvement in providing informative explanations for model decisions. This is necessary for building trust and transparency in AI-based systems, leading to the emergence of the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) field. Recently, a novel counterfactual explanation model, CELS, has been introduced. CELS learns a saliency map for the interests of an instance and generates a counterfactual explanation guided by the learned saliency map. While CELS represents the first attempt to exploit learned saliency maps not only to provide intuitive explanations for the reason behind the decision made by the time series classifier but also to explore post hoc counterfactual explanations, it exhibits limitations in terms of its high validity for the sake of ensuring high proximity and sparsity. In this paper, we present an enhanced approach that builds upon CELS. While the original model achieved promising results in terms of sparsity and proximity, it faced limitations in terms of validity. Our proposed method addresses this limitation by removing mask normalization to provide more informative and valid counterfactual explanations. Through extensive experimentation on datasets from various domains, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the CELS model, achieving higher validity and producing more informative explanations.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3188812881?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=dgOPEpf%2BVqWtq6uyYASMqlbMquU%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics14071311
Explainable Machine Learning in Critical Decision Systems: Ensuring Safe Application and Correctness,,"Wiggerthale, Julius; Wiggerthale, Julius; Reich, Christoph; Reich, Christoph",AI,Scholarly Journals,,5,4,2024-01-01,2024,2864,,,26732688,,,ENG,"Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used to support or automate decision processes in critical decision systems such as self driving cars or systems for medical diagnosis. These systems require decisions in which human lives are at stake and the decisions should therefore be well founded and very reliable. This need for reliability contrasts with the black-box nature of many ML models, making it difficult to ensure that they always behave as intended. In face of the high stakes involved, the resulting uncertainty is a significant challenge. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses the issue by making black-box models more interpretable, often to increase user trust. However, many current XAI applications focus more on transparency and usability than on enhancing safety of ML applications. In this work, we therefore conduct a systematic literature review to examine how XAI can be leveraged to increase safety of ML applications in critical decision systems. We strive to find out for what purposes XAI is currently used in critical decision systems, what are the most common XAI techniques in critical decision systems and how XAI can be harnessed to increase safety of ML applications in critical decision systems. Using the SPAR-4-SLR protocol, we are able to answer these questions and provide a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to mitigate risks of ML applications. Essentially, we identify promising approaches of XAI which go beyond increasing trust to actively ensure correctness of decisions. Our findings propose a three-layered framework to enhance safety of ML in critical decision systems by means of XAI. The approach consists of Reliability, Validation and Verification. Furthermore, we point out gaps in research and propose future directions of XAI research for enhancing safety of ML applications in critical decision systems.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3149498680?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=UJlXisnMz%2FnZH7qIQeq9uSHoIOk%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/ai5040138

Here, we used objective neurobehavioural measures (eye-tracking) to see how physicians respond to XAI with N = 19 ICU physicians in a hospital’s clinical simulation suite. Prescription decisions were made both pre- and post-reveal of either a safe or unsafe AI recommendation and four different types of simultaneously presented XAI. We used overt visual attention as a marker for where physician mental attention was directed during the simulations. Unsafe AI recommendations attracted significantly greater attention than safe AI recommendations. However, there was no appreciably higher level of attention placed onto any of the four types of explanation during unsafe AI scenarios (i.e. XAI did not appear to ‘rescue’ decision-makers). Furthermore, self-reported usefulness of explanations by physicians did not correlate with the level of attention they devoted to the explanations reinforcing the notion that using self-reports alone to evaluate XAI tools misses key aspects of the interaction behaviour between human and machine.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3087465791?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=lOttdSFle6KvoVeg1UPkas0HxuQ%3D,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-024-01200-x

Focusing on peer-reviewed journal articles that explicitly mention “Smart”, “AI”, or “Artificial Intelligence” in their titles, the research examines key safety management factors, such as accident prevention, risk management, real-time monitoring, and ethical implementation, across sectors, including construction, industrial safety, disaster and public safety, transport and logistics, energy and power, health, smart home and living, and other diverse industries. AI-driven solutions, such as predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, IoT sensor integration, and digital twin models, are shown to proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards, optimize energy consumption, and enhance operational efficiency. For instance, in the energy and power sector, intelligent gas meters and automated fire suppression systems manage gas-related risks effectively, while in the health sector, AI-powered health monitoring devices and mental health support applications improve patient and worker safety. The analysis reveals a significant trend towards shifting from reactive to proactive safety management, facilitated by the convergence of AI with IoT and Big Data analytics. Additionally, ethical considerations and data privacy emerge as critical challenges in the adoption of AI technologies. The study highlights the transformative role of AI in enhancing safety protocols, reducing accident rates, and improving overall safety outcomes across industries.

This review investigates the intersection of multi-sensor fusion and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), aiming to address the challenges of implementing accurate and interpretable AV systems. We systematically review cutting-edge multi-sensor fusion techniques, along with various explainability approaches, in the context of AV systems. While multi-sensor fusion technologies have achieved significant advancement in improving AV perception, the lack of transparency and explainability in autonomous decision-making remains a primary challenge. Our findings underscore the necessity of a balanced approach to integrating XAI and multi-sensor fusion in autonomous driving applications, acknowledging the trade-offs between real-time performance and explainability. The key challenges identified span a range of technical, social, ethical, and regulatory aspects.

However, we consider RL as fundamentally a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) paradigm, even when an agent eventually performs its task autonomously.In cases where the reward function is challenging or impossible to define, HITL approaches are considered particularly advantageous.The application of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in systems such as ChatGPT demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing for user experience and integrating their feedback into the training loop. In HITL RL, human input is integrated during the agent’s learning process, allowing iterative updates and fine-tuning based on human feedback, thus enhancing the agent’s performance. Since the human is an essential part of this process, we argue that human-centric approaches are the key to successful RL, a fact that has not been adequately considered in the existing literature. This paper aims to inform readers about current explainability methods in HITL RL. It also shows how the application of explainable AI (xAI) and specific improvements to existing explainability approaches can enable a better human-agent interaction in HITL RL for all types of users, whether for lay people, domain experts, or machine learning specialists.Accounting for the workflow in HITL RL and based on software and machine learning methodologies, this article identifies four phases for human involvement for creating HITL RL systems: (1) Agent Development, (2) Agent Learning, (3) Agent Evaluation, and (4) Agent Deployment.

This study also investigates how customer-IoT interaction influences deep learning (DL) model prediction of CPV, as well as XAI explanation and decision making on CPV prediction. The literature on customer-IoT interaction, IoT physical objects, IoT data analysis, deep learning model, XAI, and CPV was reviewed to develop a theoretical framework for investigating the relationships between IoT and XAI convergence, and CPV prediction, explanation, and decision-making towards personalised marketing. The theoretical framework and research propositions are depicted in Fig. 1. Drawing on the theoretical framework used in this study, eight key research propositions were developed on the relationship between customers, IoT, DL, XAI, and CPV explanation and decision. According to the created theoretical framework and research propositions, customer-IoT interaction generates CPV data, which is then converted into structured CPV data by IoT analytics and fed into DL models for prediction. As a result, XAI models produce explanations and decisions based on DL-enabled CPV prediction, which guides personalise marketing. This paper explains how SMEs may leverage the convergence capabilities of IoT and XAI to generate CPV explanations and decisions to modify their personalize marketing methods. Article HighlightsThe results of the present investigation demonstrate that the combination of Explainable AI and the Internet of Things improves CPV prediction, interpretation, and decision-making, which results in personalised marketing optimisation.This study establishes that deep learning models like computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement support the Internet of Things and Explainable AI convergence assessment of CPV by taking in CPV data from the Internet of Things and analysing it to create CPV predictions. Explainable AI then interprets, makes decisions, and suggests CPV strategies based on the predictions.In terms of practical implications, Internet of Things and Explainable AI convergence can significantly boost personalisation effectiveness through CPV recommendations. In order to help business managers enhance their marketing strategy, Internet of Things and Explainable AI convergence highlights the logic behind CPV recommendations for product recommendations and targeted advertising.

Recent Applications of Explainable AI (XAI): A Systematic Literature Review,,"Saarela, Mirka; Saarela, Mirka; Podgorelec, Vili",Applied Sciences,Scholarly Journals,,14,19,2024-01-01,2024,8884,,,20763417,,,ENG,"This systematic literature review employs the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology to investigate recent applications of explainable AI (XAI) over the past three years. From an initial pool of 664 articles identified through the Web of Science database, 512 peer-reviewed journal articles met the inclusion criteria—namely, being recent, high-quality XAI application articles published in English—and were analyzed in detail. Both qualitative and quantitative statistical techniques were used to analyze the identified articles: qualitatively by summarizing the characteristics of the included studies based on predefined codes, and quantitatively through statistical analysis of the data. These articles were categorized according to their application domains, techniques, and evaluation methods. Health-related applications were particularly prevalent, with a strong focus on cancer diagnosis, COVID-19 management, and medical imaging. Other significant areas of application included environmental and agricultural management, industrial optimization, cybersecurity, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Additionally, emerging applications in law, education, and social care highlight XAI’s expanding impact. The review reveals a predominant use of local explanation methods, particularly SHAP and LIME, with SHAP being favored for its stability and mathematical guarantees. However, a critical gap in the evaluation of XAI results is identified, as most studies rely on anecdotal evidence or expert opinion rather than robust quantitative metrics. This underscores the urgent need for standardized evaluation frameworks to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of XAI applications. Future research should focus on developing comprehensive evaluation standards and improving the interpretability and stability of explanations. These advancements are essential for addressing the diverse demands of various application domains while ensuring trust and transparency in AI systems.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3116645255?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=dG6cQccuJhBYMz0fYBQNlBVvwcU%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/app14198884
Explainable Boosting Machines Identify Key Metabolomic Biomarkers in Rheumatoid Arthritis,,"Yagin Fatma Hilal; Colak Cemil; Algarni Abdulmohsen; Algarni, Ali; Al-Hashem, Fahaid; Ardigò, Luca Paolo",Medicina,Scholarly Journals,,61,5,2025-01-01,2025,833,,,1010660X,,,ENG,"Background and Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by joint inflammation and pain. Metabolomics approaches, which are high-throughput profiling of small molecule metabolites in plasma or serum in RA patients, have so far provided biomarker discovery in the literature for clinical subgroups, risk factors, and predictors of treatment response using classical statistical approaches or machine learning models. Despite these recent developments, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based methodology has not been used to identify RA metabolomic biomarkers and distinguish patients with RA. This study constructed a XAI-based EBM model using global plasma metabolomics profiling to identify metabolites predictive of RA patients and to develop a classification model that can distinguish RA patients from healthy controls. Materials and Methods: Global plasma metabolomics data were analysed from RA patients (49 samples) and healthy individuals (10 samples). SMOTE technique was used for class imbalance in data preprocessing. EBM, LightGBM, and AdaBoost algorithms were applied to generate a discriminatory model between RA and controls. Comprehensive performance metrics were calculated, and the interpretability of the optimal model was assessed using global and local feature descriptions. Results: A total of 59 samples were analysed, 49 from RA patients, and 10 from healthy subjects. The EBM generated better results than LightGBM and AdaBoost by attaining an AUC of 0.901 (95% CI: 0.847–0.955) with 87.8% sensitivity which helps prevent false negative early RA diagnosis. The primary biomarkers EBM-based XAI identified were N-acetyleucine, pyruvic acid, and glycerol-3-phosphate. EBM global explanation analysis indicated that elevated pyruvic acid levels were significantly correlated with RA, whereas N-acetyleucine exhibited a nonlinear relationship, implying possible protective effects at specific concentrations. Conclusions: This study underscores the promise of XAI and evidence-based medicine methodology in developing biomarkers for RA through metabolomics. The discovered metabolites offer significant insights into RA pathophysiology and may function as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Incorporating EBM methodologies integrated with XAI improves model transparency and increases the therapeutic applicability of predictive models for RA diagnosis/management. Furthermore, the transparent structure of the EBM model empowers clinicians to understand and verify the reasoning behind each prediction, thereby fostering trust in AI-assisted decision-making and facilitating the integration of metabolomic insights into routine clinical practice.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3212073322?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=SaMf030nmKUxzs94kkjhysh8E6U%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina61050833
Second opinion machine learning for fast-track pathway assignment in hip and knee replacement surgery: the use of patient-reported outcome measures,,"Campagner, Andrea; Milella, Frida; Banfi, Giuseppe; Cabitza, Federico",BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,Scholarly Journals,,24,,2024-01-01,2024,1,,1-17,14726947,,,ENG,"BackgroundThe frequency of hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries has been rising steadily in recent decades. This trend is attributed to an aging population, leading to increased demands on healthcare systems. Fast Track (FT) surgical protocols, perioperative procedures designed to expedite patient recovery and early mobilization, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing hospital stays, convalescence periods, and associated costs. However, the criteria for selecting patients for FT procedures have not fully capitalized on the available patient data, including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).MethodsOur study focused on developing machine learning (ML) models to support decision making in assigning patients to FT procedures, utilizing data from patients’ self-reported health status. These models are specifically designed to predict the potential health status improvement in patients initially selected for FT. Our approach focused on techniques inspired by the concept of controllable AI. This includes eXplainable AI (XAI), which aims to make the model’s recommendations comprehensible to clinicians, and cautious prediction, a method used to alert clinicians about potential control losses, thereby enhancing the models’ trustworthiness and reliability.ResultsOur models were trained and tested using a dataset comprising 899 records from individual patients admitted to the FT program at IRCCS Ospedale Galeazzi-Sant’Ambrogio. After training and selecting hyper-parameters, the models were assessed using a separate internal test set. The interpretable models demonstrated performance on par or even better than the most effective ‘black-box’ model (Random Forest). These models achieved sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) exceeding 70%, with an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 80%. The cautious prediction models exhibited enhanced performance while maintaining satisfactory coverage (over 50%). Further, when externally validated on a separate cohort from the same hospital-comprising patients from a subsequent time period-the models showed no pragmatically notable decline in performance.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing PROMs as basis to develop ML models for planning assignments to FT procedures. Notably, the application of controllable AI techniques, particularly those based on XAI and cautious prediction, emerges as a promising approach. These techniques provide reliable and interpretable support, essential for informed decision-making in clinical processes.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3091290062?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=6jfEzz0xDOQxJBBOQDLIpUpruic%3D,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-024-02602-3

Multi-hazard risk-oriented early warning systems are essential to reduce impacts, enhance preparedness, and boost adaptation. Yet, the growing volume and variety of spatio-temporal data combined with the increasing frequency of concurrent extremes pose challenges to the rapid detection and tracking of harmful events. Artificial intelligence offers an opportunity to deal with these challenges, especially when interpretability and explainability are ensured. Here, we show how expert-driven and explainable artificial intelligence models can probabilistically detect multiple agriculture-related hazards. The models are trained using the work of agro-climatic experts who, over decades, operationally identified multiple climate hazards affecting agriculture in Europe. The models identify the main drivers leading to the detection of affected areas while effectively dealing with large datasets to provide probabilistic results and uncertainty estimation. Results highlight the added value of expert-driven and explainable artificial intelligence models in supporting risk management as well as effective and sustainable adaptation, particularly when integrated into early warning systems and sectoral climate services.

Findings show how representations of (1) usability, (2) trust, and (3) safety make up the main processes in human-centered XAI.

However, in many applications, even outside medicine, a lack of transparency in AI applications has become increasingly problematic. This is particularly pronounced where users need to interpret the output of AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) provides a rationale that allows users to understand why a system has produced a given output. The output can then be interpreted within a given context. One area that is in great need of XAI is that of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). These systems support medical practitioners in their clinic decision-making and in the absence of explainability may lead to issues of under or over-reliance. Providing explanations for how recommendations are arrived at will allow practitioners to make more nuanced, and in some cases, life-saving decisions. The need for XAI in CDSS, and the medical field in general, is amplified by the need for ethical and fair decision-making and the fact that AI trained with historical data can be a reinforcement agent of historical actions and biases that should be uncovered. We performed a systematic literature review of work to-date in the application of XAI in CDSS. Tabular data processing XAI-enabled systems are the most common, while XAI-enabled CDSS for text analysis are the least common in literature. There is more interest in developers for the provision of local explanations, while there was almost a balance between post-hoc and ante-hoc explanations, as well as between model-specific and model-agnostic techniques. Studies reported benefits of the use of XAI such as the fact that it could enhance decision confidence for clinicians, or generate the hypothesis about causality, which ultimately leads to increased trustworthiness and acceptability of the system and potential for its incorporation in the clinical workflow. However, we found an overall distinct lack of application of XAI in the context of CDSS and, in particular, a lack of user studies exploring the needs of clinicians.

Here, we examine AI transparency in healthcare from five angles: interpretability, privacy, security, equity, and intellectual property. We respond to this question based on recent literature discussing the transparency of AI in healthcare and on an international online survey we sent to professionals working in computing and healthcare and potentially within AI.

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts and Challenges in Healthcare,,"Hulsen, Tim",AI,Scholarly Journals,,4,3,2023-01-01,2023,652,,,26732688,,,ENG,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Examples of AI techniques are machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. AI can be applied in many different areas, such as econometrics, biometry, e-commerce, and the automotive industry. In recent years, AI has found its way into healthcare as well, helping doctors make better decisions (“clinical decision support”), localizing tumors in magnetic resonance images, reading and analyzing reports written by radiologists and pathologists, and much more. However, AI has one big risk: it can be perceived as a “black box”, limiting trust in its reliability, which is a very big issue in an area in which a decision can mean life or death. As a result, the term Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been gaining momentum. XAI tries to ensure that AI algorithms (and the resulting decisions) can be understood by humans. In this narrative review, we will have a look at some central concepts in XAI, describe several challenges around XAI in healthcare, and discuss whether it can really help healthcare to advance, for example, by increasing understanding and trust. Finally, alternatives to increase trust in AI are discussed, as well as future research possibilities in the area of XAI.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2869216448?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=WWcGfEAH%2Ff21YuZuIuiR4OK4hK0%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/ai4030034
Explainable AI improves task performance in human–AI collaboration,,,Scientific Reports (Nature Publisher Group),Scholarly Journals,,14,1,2024-01-01,2024,31150,,31150,20452322,,,ENG,"Artificial intelligence (AI) provides considerable opportunities to assist human work. However, one crucial challenge of human–AI collaboration is that many AI algorithms operate in a black-box manner where the way how the AI makes predictions remains opaque. This makes it difficult for humans to validate a prediction made by AI against their own domain knowledge. For this reason, we hypothesize that augmenting humans with explainable AI improves task performance in human–AI collaboration. To test this hypothesis, we implement explainable AI in the form of visual heatmaps in inspection tasks conducted by domain experts. Visual heatmaps have the advantage that they are easy to understand and help to localize relevant parts of an image. We then compare participants that were either supported by (a) black-box AI or (b) explainable AI, where the latter supports them to follow AI predictions when the AI is accurate or overrule the AI when the AI predictions are wrong. We conducted two preregistered experiments with representative, real-world visual inspection tasks from manufacturing and medicine. The first experiment was conducted with factory workers from an electronics factory, who performed  assessments of whether electronic products have defects. The second experiment was conducted with radiologists, who performed  assessments of chest X-ray images to identify lung lesions. The results of our experiments with domain experts performing real-world tasks show that task performance improves when participants are supported by explainable AI with heatmaps instead of black-box AI. We find that explainable AI as a decision aid improved the task performance by 7.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3% to 12.0%, ) in the manufacturing experiment and by 4.7 percentage points (95% CI: 1.1% to 8.3%, ) in the medical experiment compared to black-box AI.

Second, a Bi-LSTM model was used to detect anomalies in the simulator, which detected it before the plant’s protection system was activated in response to a threat. Finally, we applied explainable AI (XAI) to acquire insight into how distinctive features contribute to the detection of anomalies.

However, notoriously, sometimes these systems are “black boxes.” The initial response in the literature was a demand for “explainable AI.” However, recently, several authors have suggested that making AI more explainable or “interpretable” is likely to be at the cost of the accuracy of these systems and that prioritizing interpretability in medical AI may constitute a “lethal prejudice.” In this paper, we defend the value of interpretability in the context of the use of AI in medicine. Clinicians may prefer interpretable systems over more accurate black boxes, which in turn is sufficient to give designers of AI reason to prefer more interpretable systems in order to ensure that AI is adopted and its benefits realized. Moreover, clinicians may be justified in this preference. Achieving the downstream benefits from AI is critically dependent on how the outputs of these systems are interpreted by physicians and patients. A preference for the use of highly accurate black box AI systems, over less accurate but more interpretable systems, may itself constitute a form of lethal prejudice that may diminish the benefits of AI to—and perhaps even harm—patients.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3171933498?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=Vnfm%2Fm7wJzmT2PfcA1oxC3p3SKo%3D,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0963180122000664

The first study, N= 206 (Avg. age = 37.87 ± 10.51, Male = 123), utilized information presentation methods and visualizations delivered through an online experiment to explore trust in AI by asking participants to complete a visual decision-making task.

AI-driven technologies, including machine learning (ML), deep learning, computer vision, and robotic-assisted surgery, have the potential to optimize clinical workflows and improve patient outcomes. However, challenges such as data integration, ethical concerns, and regulatory barriers must be addressed to ensure AI’s safe and effective implementation. This review aims to analyze the current applications, benefits, limitations, and future directions of AI in thoracic surgery. Methods: This review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for studies published up to January 2025. Relevant articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on AI applications in thoracic surgery, including diagnostics, robotic-assisted surgery, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative care. A risk of bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. Results: Out of 279 identified studies, 36 met the inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis, highlighting AI’s growing role in diagnostic accuracy, surgical precision, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative care in thoracic surgery. AI-driven imaging analysis and radiomics have improved pulmonary nodule detection, lung cancer classification, and lymph node metastasis prediction, while robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) has enhanced surgical accuracy, reduced operative times, and improved recovery rates. Intraoperatively, AI-powered image-guided navigation, augmented reality (AR), and real-time decision-support systems have optimized surgical planning and safety. Postoperatively, AI-driven predictive models and wearable monitoring devices have enabled early complication detection and improved patient follow-up.

A short introduction to the relevant underlying core concepts of machine learning shall nurture the reader's understanding of why explainability is a specific issue in this field. Addressing this issue of explainability, the rapidly evolving research field of explainable AI (XAI) has developed many techniques and methods to make black‐box machine‐learning systems more transparent.

This is especially relevant in the medical field since explainability and causability play a crucial role also for compliance with regulatory requirements. We conclude by promoting the need for novel user interfaces for AI applications in pathology, which enable contextual understanding and allow the medical expert to ask interactive ‘what‐if’‐questions. In pathology, such user interfaces will not only be important to achieve a high level of causability.

The research demonstrates how SoS-ML addresses key challenges in XAI, such as enhancing explanation accuracy and aligning AI reasoning with human cognition. By leveraging a multi-agent, modular design, SoS-ML encourages collaboration among machine learning models, leading to more transparent, context-aware systems. The framework’s ability to generalize across domains is demonstrated through experiments on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and pie chart image-to-text interpretation, showcasing its transformative potential in improving both model accuracy and explainability.

Time-Based Stress and Procedural Justice: Can Transparency Mitigate the Effects of Algorithmic Compensation in Gig Work?,,"Semujanga, Benjamin; Parent-Rocheleau, Xavier",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,Scholarly Journals,,21,1,2024-01-01,2024,86,,,1661-7827,,,ENG,"The gig economy has led to a new management style, using algorithms to automate managerial decisions. Algorithmic management has aroused the interest of researchers, particularly regarding the prevalence of precarious working conditions and the health issues related to gig work. Despite algorithmically driven remuneration mechanisms’ influence on work conditions, few studies have focused on the compensation dimension of algorithmic management. We investigate the effects of algorithmic compensation on gig workers in relation to perceptions of procedural justice and time-based stress, two important predictors of work-related health problems. Also, this study examines the moderating effect of algorithmic transparency in these relationships. Survey data were collected from 962 gig workers via a research panel. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analysis show that the degree of exposure to algorithmic compensation is positively related to time-based stress. However, contrary to our expectations, algorithmic compensation is also positively associated with procedural justice perceptions and our results indicate that this relation is enhanced at higher levels of perceived algorithmic transparency. Furthermore, transparency does not play a role in the relationship between algorithmic compensation and time-based stress. These findings suggest that perceived algorithmic transparency makes algorithmic compensation even fairer but does not appear to make it less stressful.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2918765355?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=3bTdK%2FNo71Pk7ri5Tbove%2FvtHEY%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph21010086

Although data scientists, researchers, and medical experts have been working in the direction of designing and developing computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tools to serve as assistants to doctors, their large-scale adoption and integration into the healthcare system still seems far-fetched. Diagnostic radiology is no exception. Imagining techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scans have been widely and very effectively employed by radiologists and neurologists for the differential diagnoses of neurological disorders for decades, yet no AI-powered systems to analyze such scans have been incorporated into the standard operating procedures of healthcare systems. Why? It is absolutely understandable that in diagnostic medicine, precious human lives are on the line, and hence there is no room even for the tiniest of mistakes. Nevertheless, with the advent of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the old-school black boxes of deep learning (DL) systems have been unraveled. Would XAI be the turning point for medical experts to finally embrace AI in diagnostic radiology? This review is a humble endeavor to find the answers to these questions. Methods: In this review, we present the journey and contributions of AI in developing systems to recognize, preprocess, and analyze brain MRI scans for differential diagnoses of various neurological disorders, with special emphasis on CAD systems embedded with explainability. A comprehensive review of the literature from 2017 to 2024 was conducted using host databases. We also present medical domain experts’ opinions and summarize the challenges up ahead that need to be addressed in order to fully exploit the tremendous potential of XAI in its application to medical diagnostics and serve humanity. Results: Forty-seven studies were summarized and tabulated with information about the XAI technology and datasets employed, along with performance accuracies. The strengths and weaknesses of the studies have also been discussed. In addition, the opinions of seven medical experts from around the world have been presented to guide engineers and data scientists in developing such CAD tools. Conclusions: Current CAD research was observed to be focused on the enhancement of the performance accuracies of the DL regimens, with less attention being paid to the authenticity and usefulness of explanations. A shortage of ground truth data for explainability was also observed. Visual explanation methods were found to dominate; however, they might not be enough, and more thorough and human professor-like explanations would be required to build the trust of healthcare professionals. Special attention to these factors along with the legal, ethical, safety, and security issues can bridge the current gap between XAI and routine clinical practice.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3159473733?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=%2B59nmia6gJOPLb2Id58F2pDtxGE%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics15020168

Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks were trained to predict the target selection decisions of expert and novice players completing a multiagent herding task. The results revealed that the trained LSTM models could not only accurately predict the target selection decisions of expert and novice players but that these predictions could be made at timescales that preceded a player’s conscious intent. Importantly, the models were also expertise specific, in that models trained to predict the target selection decisions of experts could not accurately predict the target selection decisions of novices (and vice versa). To understand what differentiated expert and novice target selection decisions, we employed the explainable-AI technique, SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP), to identify what informational features (variables) most influenced modelpredictions. The SHAP analysis revealed that experts were more reliant on information about target direction of heading and the location of coherders (i.e., other players) compared to novices.

This review paper provides an in-depth analysis of both aspects. We review established and recent methods to account for uncertainty in ML models and XAI approaches and we discuss empirical evidence on how model uncertainty is perceived by human users of XAI systems. We summarize the methodological advancements and limitations of methods and human perception.

This study presents an explainable multi-layer dynamic ensemble framework designed to detect depression and assess its severity, aiming to improve diagnostic precision and provide insights into contributing health factors. Methods: Using data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), this framework combines classical machine learning models, static ensemble methods, and dynamic ensemble selection (DES) approaches across two stages: detection and severity prediction. The depression detection stage classifies individuals as normal or depressed, while the severity prediction stage further classifies depressed cases as mild or moderate-severe. Finally, a confirmation depression scale prediction model estimates depression severity scores to support the two stages. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are applied to improve model interpretability, making the framework more suitable for clinical applications. Results: The framework’s FIRE-KNOP DES algorithm demonstrated high efficacy, achieving 88.33% accuracy in depression detection and 83.68% in severity prediction. XAI analysis identified mental and non-mental health indicators as significant factors in the framework’s performance, emphasizing the value of these features for accurate depression assessment.

XAI Helps in Storm Surge Forecasts: A Case Study for the Southeastern Chinese Coasts,,"Han, Lei; Lu, Wenfang; Dong Changming",Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,Scholarly Journals,,13,5,2025-01-01,2025,896,,,20771312,,,ENG,"Storm surge forecasting presents a significant challenge for coastal resilience, particularly in typhoon-prone regions such as southeastern China, where compound flooding events lead to substantial socioeconomic losses. Although artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown strong potential in storm surge prediction, their inherent “black-box” nature limits both their interpretability and operational trust. In this study, we integrate a Vision Transformer (ViT) model with an explainable AI (XAI) method—specifically, Shapley value analysis (SHAP)—to develop an interpretable, high-performance storm surge forecasting framework. The baseline ViT model demonstrates excellent predictive skill, achieving spatiotemporal correlation coefficients exceeding 0.90 over a 12 h lead time. However, it exhibits systematic underestimations in topographically complex regions, such as semi-enclosed bays (e.g., up to 0.06 m). SHAP analysis reveals that the model primarily relies on the autocorrelation of historical surge levels rather than external wind forcing—contrary to the conventional physical understanding of storm surge dynamics. Guided by these insights, we introduce the surge time difference (ΔZ/Δt) as an explicit input feature to enhance the model’s physical representation. This modification yields substantial improvements: during the critical first hour of forecasting—a key window for disaster mitigation—the RMSE is reduced from 0.01 m to 0.005 m, while the correlation coefficient increases from 0.92 to 0.98. This study bridges the gap between data-driven forecasting and physical interpretability, offering a transparent and trustworthy framework for next-generation intelligent storm surge prediction.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3212028175?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=4HW0OUHv3kF%2FPPZY%2FAd%2Fklifd4E%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse13050896

The popular press has highlighted several high-profile cases of algorithmic discrimination and the issue has gained traction.

These could be due to users’ individual differences, which have rarely been systematically studied regarding their inhibiting or enabling effect on the fulfillment of explanation objectives (such as trust, understanding, or workload). This paper aims to shed light on the significance of human dimensions (gender, age, trust disposition, need for cognition, affinity for technology, self-efficacy, attitudes, and mind attribution) as well as their interplay with different explanation modes (no, simple, or complex explanation). Participants played the game Deal or No Deal while interacting with an AI-based agent. The agent gave advice to the participants on whether they should accept or reject the deals offered to them. As expected, giving an explanation had a positive influence on the explanation objectives. However, the users’ individual characteristics particularly reinforced the fulfillment of the objectives. The strongest predictor of objective fulfillment was the degree of attribution of human characteristics. The more human characteristics were attributed, the more trust was placed in the agent, advice was more likely to be accepted and understood, and important needs were satisfied during the interaction.

Machine learning techniques have demonstrated high efficiency in identifying CKD, but their opaque decision-making processes limit their adoption in clinical settings. To address this, this study employs a generative adversarial network (GAN) to handle missing values in CKD datasets and utilizes few-shot learning techniques, such as prototypical networks and model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), combined with explainable machine learning to predict CKD. Additionally, traditional machine learning models, including support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and voting ensemble learning (VEL), are applied for comparison. To unravel the “black box” nature of machine learning predictions, various techniques of explainable AI, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), are applied to understand the predictions made by the model, thereby contributing to the decision-making process and identifying significant parameters in the diagnosis of CKD. Model performance is evaluated using predefined metrics, and the results indicate that few-shot learning models integrated with GANs significantly outperform traditional machine learning techniques. Prototypical networks with GANs achieve the highest accuracy of 99.99%, while MAML reaches 99.92%. Furthermore, prototypical networks attain F1-score, recall, precision, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values of 99.89%, 99.9%, 99.9%, and 100%, respectively, on the raw dataset.

A prototype system based on modern NLP techniques has been developed to match patient records with phase 1 oncology clinical trial protocols. Four criteria are considered for the matching: cancer type, performance status, genetic mutation, and measurable disease. The system outputs a summary matching score along with explanations of the evidence. The outputs of the AI system were evaluated against the ground truth matching results provided by the domain expert on a dataset of twelve synthesized dummy patient records and six clinical trial protocols. The system achieved a precision of 73.68%, sensitivity/recall of 56%, accuracy of 77.78%, and specificity of 89.36%. Further investigation into the misclassified cases indicated that ambiguity of abbreviation and misunderstanding of context are significant contributors to errors. The system found evidence of no matching for all false positive cases. To the best of our knowledge, no system in the public domain currently deploys an explainable AI-based approach to identify optimal patients for phase 1 oncology trials.

The current AI landscape is dominated by machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning algorithms, that have been effective in addressing some of these challenges.

This lack of transparency constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. For the present study, it is a major drawback to the deployment of deep learning methods mandated with detecting patterns and prognosticating Alzheimer’s disease.

Interpretability Is in the Mind of the Beholder: A Causal Framework for Human-Interpretable Representation Learning,,"Marconato, Emanuele; Passerini, Andrea; Teso, Stefano; Teso, Stefano",Entropy,Scholarly Journals,,25,12,2023-01-01,2023,1574,,,10994300,,,ENG,"Research on Explainable Artificial Intelligence has recently started exploring the idea of producing explanations that, rather than being expressed in terms of low-level features, are encoded in terms of interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both post hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in human-interpretable representation learning (hrl) is how to model and operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both post hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of hrl builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us derive a principled notion of alignment between the machine’s representation and the vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of representations, namely disentanglement. We also show that alignment is linked to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on human-interpretable representations.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2904645312?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=y7WZRF8%2B5L9Oz%2FcJhpAJZ745bs8%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/e25121574

However, existing methods must also highlight the importance of features to provide more actionable explanations that would aid in the identification of key drivers behind model decisions—and, hence, more reliable interpretations—ensuring better accuracy. The method we propose utilizes feature weights obtained through adaptive feature weight genetic explanation (AFWGE) with the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to determine the most crucial group of features. The proposed method was tested on four real datasets with nine different classifiers for evaluation against a nonweighted counterfactual explanation method (CERTIFAI) and the original feature values’ correlation.

Specifically, we proposed a scenario-based explanation framework based on explainable AI and examined the effects of these explanations on drivers’ objective and subjective performance. The results of Experiment 1 indicated that the scenario-based explanations effectively improved drivers’ situational trust and user experience (UX), thereby enhancing the perception and understanding that drivers had of the system’s intelligence capabilities. These explanations significantly reduced the mental workload and elevated the user performance in objective evaluations. In Experiment 2, we uncovered distinct explainability preferences among new and frequent users. New users sought increased trust and transparency, benefiting from guided explanations. In contrast, frequent users emphasised efficiency and driving safety. The final experimental results confirmed that solutions customised for different segments of the population are significantly more effective, satisfying, and trustworthy than generic solutions.

For this topic, the framing of conventional risk and decision analyses is ongoing. This paper introduces a method to quantify risk as the disruption of the order of AI initiatives in healthcare systems, aiming to find the scenarios that are most and least disruptive to system order. This novel approach addresses scenarios that bring about a re-ordering of initiatives in each of the following three characteristic layers: purpose, structure, and function. In each layer, the following model elements are identified: 1. Typical research and development initiatives in healthcare. 2. The ordering criteria of the initiatives. 3.

This approach is a manifold accounting of the scenarios that could contribute to the risk associated with AI in healthcare. Recognizing the context-specific nature of risks and highlighting the role of human in the loop, this study identifies scenario s.06—non-interpretable AI and lack of human–AI communications—as the most disruptive across all three layers of healthcare systems.

This research aims to investigate the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, particularly SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), to identify key factors influencing road accident severity and create a social marketing campaign encouraging people to change their behavior in relation to road safety. Several machine learning models were developed using data from Thailand’s Ministry of Transport. The results show that the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.85 and an F1 score of 0.83. SHAP analysis revealed that the most significant contributing factors were the number of motorcycle involvements, road code, and the total number of vehicles and people involved in the accident. A practical framework for promoting sustainable road safety was proposed, focusing on raising awareness, delivering emotionally impactful communication, and fostering immediate behavioral change. This research provides valuable insights for strategic road safety initiatives and demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning with XAI. The findings can guide government authorities, policymakers, insurance companies, and social marketing planners in improving road safety.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/3201815663?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=Euorj8w9j6aJkSMOpxd%2F%2FYbr2EI%3D,https://doi.org/10.59865/abacj.2024.70

Auguring Fake Face Images Using Dual Input Convolution Neural Network,,"Bhandari, Mohan; Neupane, Arjun; Mallik, Saurav; Mallik, Saurav; Gaur, Loveleen; Gaur, Loveleen; Qin, Hong",Journal of Imaging,Scholarly Journals,,9,1,2023-01-01,2023,3,,,2313433X,,,ENG,"Deepfake technology uses auto-encoders and generative adversarial networks to replace or artificially construct fine-tuned faces, emotions, and sounds. Although there have been significant advancements in the identification of particular fake images, a reliable counterfeit face detector is still lacking, making it difficult to identify fake photos in situations with further compression, blurring, scaling, etc. Deep learning models resolve the research gap to correctly recognize phony images, whose objectionable content might encourage fraudulent activity and cause major problems. To reduce the gap and enlarge the fields of view of the network, we propose a dual input convolutional neural network (DICNN) model with ten-fold cross validation with an average training accuracy of 99.36 ± 0.62, a test accuracy of 99.08 ± 0.64, and a validation accuracy of 99.30 ± 0.94. Additionally, we used ’SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) ’ as explainable AI (XAI) Shapely values to explain the results and interoperability visually by imposing the model into SHAP. The proposed model holds significant importance for being accepted by forensics and security experts because of its distinctive features and considerably higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2767221877?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=dpzN9l1h5iGJ2cAdN5Inb2sjBEE%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/jimaging9010003
Contrastive Explanations of Plans through Model Restrictions,,"Krarup, Benjamin; Krivic, Senka; Magazzeni, Daniele; Long, Derek; Cashmore, Michael; Smith, David E",The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research,Scholarly Journals,,72,,2021-01-01,2021,533,,533-612,10769757,,,ENG,"In automated planning, the need for explanations arises when there is a mismatch between a proposed plan and the user’s expectation. We frame Explainable AI Planning as an iterative plan exploration process, in which the user asks a succession of contrastive questions that lead to the generation and solution of hypothetical planning problems that are restrictions of the original problem. The object of the exploration is for the user to understand the constraints that govern the original plan and, ultimately, to arrive at a satisfactory plan. We present the results of a user study that demonstrates that when users ask questions about plans, those questions are usually contrastive, i.e. “why A rather than B?”. We use the data from this study to construct a taxonomy of user questions that often arise during plan exploration. Our approach to iterative plan exploration is a process of successive model restriction. Each contrastive user question imposes a set of constraints on the planning problem, leading to the construction of a new hypothetical planning problem as a restriction of the original. Solving this restricted problem results in a plan that can be compared with the original plan, admitting a contrastive explanation. We formally define model-based compilations in PDDL2.1 for each type of constraint derived from a contrastive user question in the taxonomy, and empirically evaluate the compilations in terms of computational complexity. The compilations were implemented as part of an explanation framework supporting iterative model restriction. We demonstrate its benefits in a second user study.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2590055891?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=ainmtkFBbDWA3lvTsoh0cplJ%2Bdk%3D,https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.12813
Predicting the Volume of Response to Tweets Posted by a Single Twitter Account,,"Fiok, Krzysztof; Karwowski, Waldemar; Gutierrez, Edgar; Ahram, Tareq",Symmetry,Scholarly Journals,,12,6,2020-01-01,2020,1054,,,20738994,,,ENG,"Social media users, including organizations, often struggle to acquire the maximum number of responses from other users, but predicting the responses that a post will receive before publication is highly desirable. Previous studies have analyzed why a given tweet may become more popular than others, and have used a variety of models trained to predict the response that a given tweet will receive. The present research addresses the prediction of response measures available on Twitter, including likes, replies and retweets. Data from a single publisher, the official US Navy Twitter account, were used to develop a feature-based model derived from structured tweet-related data. Most importantly, a deep learning feature extraction approach for analyzing unstructured tweet text was applied. A classification task with three classes, representing low, moderate and high responses to tweets, was defined and addressed using four machine learning classifiers. All proposed models were symmetrically trained in a fivefold cross-validation regime using various feature configurations, which allowed for the methodically sound comparison of prediction approaches. The best models achieved F1 scores of 0.655. Our study also used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to demonstrate limitations in the research on explainable AI methods involving Deep Learning Language Modeling in NLP. We conclude that model performance can be significantly improved by leveraging additional information from the images and links included in tweets.",https://www.proquest.com/docview/2418817931?accountid=15181&bdid=109693&_bd=wl3ilZuAdASI114Vro80R5l24cE%3D,https://doi.org/10.3390/sym12061054

### üîç Screening Questions

1. **Does the study involve operational human-AI systems?**
2. **Is explanation (needs, types, triggers and mechanisms) a central focus of the research?** **Are operational needs from explanation discussed?**
3. **Does the study consider explanations at a systems level (potentially containing multiple AI components and multiple people interacting)?**
